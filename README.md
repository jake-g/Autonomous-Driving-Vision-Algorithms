# Autonomous Driving Algorithm Prototypes

### Overview
Programs for mono or stereo cameras that focus on realtime detection. These are prototyped in Matlab, but can be ported to C using Matlab code generation or porting to OpenCV. The [Kitti Database](http://www.cvlibs.net/datasets/kitti/) is a great resource for stereo data.

### Demos
Demos for many of these and other non Matlab implementations can be found on [this YouTube cannel](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLWptjpDqazOymOtZTLaiW0OCP8Qe2uAKr)
