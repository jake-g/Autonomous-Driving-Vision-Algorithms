# ADAS


#### Feature Development
ADAS code belongs here. Create your own branch to develop off of, then merge to master when it is complete and working. Each project/feature should have a folder named based off the feature.

Note video files should be stored on the drive here, and not on the repo. Also no need for HD videos, downsample them to make your code run faster and save space on the cloud

#### Competition Deliverables
EcoCAR deliverables are located in the `EcoCAR_Deliverables` folder. The fall deliverable is complete and the winter one is in progress.


#### Datastore
Datasets used by the code (videos and pictures) are not included in the repo. To get these files, create a `datastore` folder on the root of this repo, and grab necessary datastore files from our archive **[HERE](https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B-HGy6dgp_EHZXJVdU5oVFJRNWs)**

#### Example Code
Mathworks example code is found **[HERE](https://drive.google.com/a/uw.edu/folderview?id=0B-HGy6dgp_EHV2pBU3hNMmdnd2s&usp=sharing)**, and is highly recommended. There are even more example on their homepage **[HERE](http://www.mathworks.com/examples/product-group/matlab-image-processing-and-computer-vision)**

The *Fall Mathworks* examples provide videos and code examples for:
* Importing video
* Image processing
* Classification
* Object detection
* Feature Matching

The *Winter Mathworks* examples provide slides and code for:
* Line detection
* Text Reading (OCR)
* People detection
* Ground Truth (Classification validation)
* Stereo Vision and Point Clouds
